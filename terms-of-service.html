                <h3>Nature of Services</h3>
                <p>We provide professional psychological assessment, psychotherapy, counseling, and related mental health services. Our services are provided by licensed psychologists and mental health professionals in accordance with New York State regulations and professional ethical standards.</p>
                
                <h3>Therapeutic Relationship</h3>
                <p>The therapeutic relationship is a professional relationship designed to support your mental health and well-being. While we strive to provide the highest quality care, we cannot guarantee specific outcomes or results from treatment.</p>

                <h3>Scope of Practice</h3>
                <p>Our services do not include emergency or crisis intervention. If you are experiencing a mental health emergency, please call 911, go to your nearest emergency room, or contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988.</p>

                <h3>Telehealth Services</h3>
                <p>We offer telehealth sessions via secure, HIPAA-compliant video conferencing. You are responsible for ensuring a private, quiet location with reliable internet connectivity for your telehealth appointments.</p>
